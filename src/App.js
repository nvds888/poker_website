            <p>
              In a world of constant competition and variance, the players who prioritize their mental and physical
              health create a lasting edge over the rest.
            </p>

            <p>
              Success in poker isn't about playing more hands â€” it's about showing up every day with focus, energy, and
              a performance mindset.
            </p>

            <p className="emphasis-text">Just like in any sport, the same principles apply:</p>

            <ul className="principle-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Build structure</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Implement discipline</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Set clear, actionable goals</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Take consistent, purposeful action</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Whether you're battling variance, losing focus deep into a session, or struggling to find balance away
              from the tables â€” the solution is the same: build the foundation first.
            </p>

            <p className="final-emphasis">
              This isn't just about becoming a better poker player. It's about becoming a stronger, more focused version
              of yourself â€” in poker and in life.

              <p className="about-text">
                Hi, my name is <strong>Tim</strong>, I'm 26 years old, and my passion is poker. I've been playing
                competitively for the past two years â€” and it's become so much more than just a game to me.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p className="about-text">
              Before discovering poker, I spent my entire life playing football, competing professionally for five years
              from age 19 to 24. Unfortunately, a severe ankle injury brought that chapter to an end â€” and with it, the
              competitive lifestyle that had shaped me for so long.
            </p>

            <p className="about-text">
              Transitioning into poker gave me a second chance to channel that same drive for performance, growth, and
              excellence. I quickly realized how much of what I learned in professional sports translates directly to
              poker: discipline, focus, structure, recovery, and constant self-improvement.
            </p>

            <p className="about-text">
              Poker brought me back into a high-performance environment, where mindset and preparation matter just as
              much as skill. I'm incredibly grateful for that.
            </p>

            <p className="about-text final-paragraph">
              Alongside building my own poker career and steadily moving up in stakes, I decided to start coaching â€” to
              share what I've learned from both worlds. Having experienced the demands of professional sports and the
              mental challenges of poker, I'm passionate about helping players develop the structure, habits, and
              mindset to perform at their best â€” both at and away from the tables.
